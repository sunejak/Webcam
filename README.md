Download NOOBS v1.3.2 and unzip it onto the empty FAT formatted SD card.

Install SD card, connect keyboard, mouse, monitor and network cable.
For you own sake use the HDMI output, and thing don't get to crammed on the screen.
Power up, and select "Raspbian", and install (i), and answer "yes" to the questions.
This takes quite a bit of time (0.5 Mb/sec)
